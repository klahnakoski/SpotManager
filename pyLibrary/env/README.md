Environment
===========

This directory is for connecting to other systems. Generally, these
classes are facades that assume content is UTF-8 encoded JSON.



emailer
-------

A simple emailer, the primary purpose is to accept a [Data](../dot/README.md)
of settings.


pulse
-----

For connecting clients to [Mozilla's Pulse](https://pulse.mozilla.org/).


elasticsearch
-------------

This module handles the lifecycle of an Elasticsearch index in the context of
ETL. You only need this module if you are creating and retiring indexes. You
do not need this module for simply searching; for that I suggest using the
rest API directly.

### Settings ###

Both ```Cluster``` and ```Index``` objects accept the same settings dict,
selecting only the properties it requires.

	{
		"host" : "http://192.168.0.98",
		"port" : 9200,
		"index" : "b2g_tests",
		"type" : "test_result",
		"debug" : true,
		"limit_replicas" : true,
		"schema_file" : "./resources/schema/test_schema.json"
	},
